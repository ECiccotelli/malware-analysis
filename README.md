# Malware Analysis Scripts

Scripts for Cuckoo Malware Analysis 
# Purpose of these Scripts
* The getReports.py script automatically reads and saves reports generated from Cuckoo into .json files on your computer
* The submitSamples.py script submits all samples in a given folder to Cuckoo for analysis

Both of these scripts can be combined in order to submit a sample for analysis, then download the report when the analysis is complete.
